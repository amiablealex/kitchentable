# üè† The Kitchen Table

A warm, intimate web application for staying connected with the people you care about through daily conversation prompts.

- **Simple & Beautiful**: Clean, modern interface optimized for all devices
- **Privacy First**: See others' responses only after you've shared yours
- **Lightweight**: Runs efficiently on a Raspberry Pi 4

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3)
- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, modern CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with httpOnly cookies
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn, Nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel

## Architecture Highlights

### Security
- Bcrypt password hashing
- JWT authentication with secure httpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection through SameSite cookie policy
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### Performance
- SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent reads
- Indexed queries for fast lookups
- Static asset caching
- Gzip compression
- Efficient polling (30-second intervals)

### User Experience
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Minimal JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Graceful error handling
- Loading states and feedback

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run application in debug mode
python3 app.py
```

### Database Migrations
Database schema is in `schema.sql`. For changes:

1. Update `schema.sql`
2. Create migration script if needed
3. Test thoroughly before deploying

### Adding New Prompts
Edit `seed_prompts.sql` and re-run the seed script, or add them directly:

```sql
INSERT INTO default_prompts (prompt_text, category) 
VALUES ('Your new prompt here', 'category');
```

## Deployment

Designed to run on Raspberry Pi 4 with:
- Gunicorn as WSGI server (port 8003)
- Nginx as reverse proxy
- Cloudflare Tunnel for secure external access
- Systemd for service management
- Cron for daily prompt generation

See [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for complete deployment guide.
